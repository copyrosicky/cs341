Re-Ranking Layer for Product Search Engine

## Summary

Walmart.com maintains an online catalog of over 2M products. Consequently, enabling users
to quickly find products that conform to their specific needs and tastes is especially
challenging. Given the difficulty of its task, Walmart.com’s product search engine does
an impressive job of interpretting the user-provided query and rapidly returning relevant
results. Yet, there remains highly significant information that is not fully leveraged. The
details of a user’s online shopping session are indicative of a user’s intent and compliment
--indeed, provide context for—the user-provided query. This code is the implementation of
an ordering scheme we call Session Re-Rank (SRR) that can potentially induce a large increase
in both click-through-rates and conversions on the first page of query results.
